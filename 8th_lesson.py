#OOP in python
# class
# object
# instance
# class is a blueprint for creating objects
# object is an instance of a class
# instance is a specific object created from a class
#for example, if we have a class called Dog, we can create an object called my_dog which is an instance of the Dog class.
# class Dog:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
#     def bark(self):
#         print("Woof! Woof!")
#     def get_name(self):
#         return self.name
#     def get_age(self):
#         return self.age
#     def set_name(self, name):
#         self.name = name
#     def set_age(self, age):
#         self.age = age    
# #create an object of the Dog class
# my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
# #call the bark method
# my_dog.bark()
# #get the name of the dog
# print(my_dog.get_name())
# #get the age of the dog
# print(my_dog.get_age())
# #set the name of the dog
# my_dog.set_name("Max")
# #set the age of the dog
# my_dog.set_age(4)
# #get the name of the dog
# print(my_dog.get_name())
# #get the age of the dog
# print(my_dog.get_age())
